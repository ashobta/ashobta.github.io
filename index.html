            <p class="texts">Joining as a System Service Engineer, I was assigned at various type of work.

            Implementing hard skill such as: Programming, <b>Logic,</b> and Instrumentation; combined with soft skill such as: <b>communication</b> with leads and customers, team work, and the ability to adapt under pressure.

              <p id="ykgwlist1_p" class="nesteded">Through activities like troubleshooting, on-call services, and remote support,
                I learned to solve problems with various methods. Either with general knowledge like
                root-cause analysis, skimming through manuals, and even escalating to the experts.

                With activities like Shutdown Maintenance and Modification Projects, I learned and practiced good communications
                within team members. Active listening, being assertive, and reporting in time were several key takeaways experiences.

                not only in site activities, but often time customer seek remote help and support that I must answer. If I myself can't resolve
                it, I will seek help from seniors and my supervisors.

              Supporting the account managers, I propose a new method to <br> 
              <b>data visualization</b>: Google Data Studio.
              Legacy model relies heavily on manually making graphs in Excel. 
              New data means new job, even though they basically used the same old graph  template.
              I learned so much about the importance of <b>progress</b> and also <b>honoring legacy</b>, as totally new method 
              won't be adapted easily. Combining the two was my greatest enjoyment.
