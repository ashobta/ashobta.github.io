              Implementing hard skill such as: Programming, <b>Logic,</b> and Instrumentation; combined with soft skill such as: <b>communication</b> with leads and customers, team work, and the ability to adapt under pressure.

                Supporting the account managers, I propose a new method to <br> 
                <b>data visualization</b>: Google Data Studio.
                Legacy model relies heavily on manually making graphs in Excel. 
                New data means new job, even though they basically used the same old graph  template.
                I learned so much about the importance of <b>progress</b> and also <b>honoring legacy</b>, as totally new method 
                won't be adapted easily. Combining the two was my greatest enjoyment.
